# IMPORTANT

This is a backup copy of the Xdolf repository, made three minutes after the announcement that Xdolf would be made closed-source and obfuscated was made. This is the last known clean copy of Xdolf's repository. No changes, other than to this README.md file, have been made.

x0XP and Sgt. Pepper uploaded the full Minecraft source code as generated by the Mod Coder Pack mappings, with their hooks and modifications added in as well. This cannot have GPL3 applied to it. However, I will be keeping my pledge to not modify this repository from its original form.

You can download the last known clean version of Xdolf from the Releases section. I will also provide a copy built straight from this repository (unobfuscated).
